Out of 7043 customers aproximately 50% are women ,25% senior citizens, 36% are partners and 17% dependents.Most of the customers are subscribing less than a year and they churn.Paperless billing and electronic cards are more popular.Customers prefer month to month type of contacts maybe because  of the uncertanity of services provided by the company thereby having the lowwest number of customers on a one year contract.Most famous services signed up by customers are the phone service and streaming TV with 42% of customers having multiple lines.Customers opt for Fiber optic to DSL.

The churn rate is 27% which is not too bad but still high.As noted befor a lot of people opt for fiber optic type of internet service and as shown above the amount for monthly charges is the highest which is one reason customers are churning most probably to other companies in search for lower monthly charge rates. 



## Conclusion and Recommendation
- The company should segment and target customers based on demographics and preferences including gender and service preferences. Tailor marketing messages and 
  offers specifically to female customers for example who opt for fiber optic services, highlighting to them value and benefits of the service to meet their needs.
- l would also recommend the company to review pricing strategies and consider offering flexible pricing plans or discounts for fiber optic services to make them 
  more affordable for customers, particularly female,independent and senior citizens customers who may be sensitive to price.
